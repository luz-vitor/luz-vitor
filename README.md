### Hello, my name is Vitor Luz 👋 

I have a degree and specialization in Civil Engineering, and I'm currently making a cool transition to Computer Science! 😎 
My primary focus right now is scientific research in Machine Learning, using Python and PyTorch. 
I'm dedicating my time to enhancing my skills in this area and adding exercises related to the topic to this repository.

Feel free to reach out to me! ✌️
